As a cocktail enthusiast, answering "What do you want to drink?" is one of the hardest questions. 
I've spent tons of time years ago making great drinks that sometimes just get forgotten. This hopefully is a better way to track my creations, and an easy way to recall them.

Whenever you load or refresh the site it will return a random drink that I have liked in the past.
You can also search by drink name.
You can search ingredients too, to randomly return a drink using that ingredient. Great for when you have a bottle of something and dont know what to do with it.

This uses a supabase postgresql backend database, hosted on vercel, and this code.
Do I code JavaScript? eh not really, but AI does. And what I can code covers the rest.
